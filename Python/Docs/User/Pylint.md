PyLint
======

For [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707), we have added support for running [PyLint](http://pylint.org/) in PTVS.

In Solution Explorer, you'll see a command to run PyLint on your Python project node.

If you don't have PyLint installed, it will prompt you to install it into your active Python environment.

The errors reported by PyLint will appear in the Error List window. Double-click on an error and it will take you to the source code.

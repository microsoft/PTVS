Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe /NoRegistry=1 /S /D=c:\installed

Once install has finished (miniconda executable keeps running even after it's done?), delete the contents of the pkgs folder, but keep the empty folder. As the user install conda packages, they will get cached in the user's local app data folder.

Create a condarc file in c:\installed:

# directories in which environments are located
envs_dirs:
  - ~/.conda/envs

Delete the contents of Miniconda3-x64, and replace with the contents of c:\installed

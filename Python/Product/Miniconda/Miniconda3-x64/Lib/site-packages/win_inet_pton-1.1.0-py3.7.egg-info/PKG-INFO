        --------------------------
        
        This package is based on code that was originally written by https://github.com/nnemkin here: https://gist.github.com/nnemkin/4966028
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        I needed this functionality in https://github.com/SerenitySoftwareLLC/cahoots to get full windows support. I figured, since there were other people looking for a solution to this on the net, I should publish it.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
         .. code-block:: bash
        
            python -m pip install win_inet_pton
        
        Just import it, and it will auto-add the methods to the socket library:
        
         .. code-block:: python
        
            import win_inet_pton
            import socket
        
            socket.inet_pton(...)
            socket.inet_ntop(...)

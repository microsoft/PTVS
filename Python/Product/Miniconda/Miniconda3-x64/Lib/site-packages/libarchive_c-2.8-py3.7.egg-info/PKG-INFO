        A Python interface to libarchive. It uses the standard ctypes_ module to
        dynamically load and access the C library.

        Installation
        ============
        
            pip install libarchive-c
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        python-libarchive-c is currently tested with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
        
        If you find an incompatibility with older versions you can send us a small patch,
        but we won't accept big changes.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Import::
        
            import libarchive
        
        To extract an archive to the current directory::
        
            libarchive.extract_file('test.zip')
        
        ``extract_memory`` extracts from a buffer instead, and ``extract_fd`` extracts
        from a file descriptor.
        
        To read an archive::
        
            with libarchive.file_reader('test.7z') as archive:
                for entry in archive:
                    for block in entry.get_blocks():
                        ...
        
        ``memory_reader`` reads from a memory buffer instead, and ``fd_reader`` reads
        from a file descriptor.
        
        To create an archive::
        
            with libarchive.file_writer('test.tar.gz', 'ustar', 'gzip') as archive:
                archive.add_files('libarchive/', 'README.rst')
        
        ``memory_writer`` writes to a memory buffer instead, ``fd_writer`` writes to a
        file descriptor, and ``custom_writer`` sends the data to a callback function.
        
        You can also find more thorough examples in the ``tests/`` directory.

    <h1 class="top">Configuring Deployment</h1>

    <p>
        Some PowerShell scripts have been added to your project to configure and
        launch your worker. These may be edited freely to customize your
        deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
        To change the version of Python your worker should run with, set the
        <code>PYTHON</code> property in the <code>ServiceDefinition.csdef</code>
        file in your cloud project. See <code>ConfigureCloudService.ps1</code>
        for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
        To install packages using pip, update the <code>requirements.txt</code>
        file in the root directory of your project. The PowerShell script will
        install packages listed in it on deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
        To set <code>PYTHONPATH</code> (or equivalent) before running the
        worker, add the environment variable to your
        <code>ServiceDefinition.csdef</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To specify the script to run and any arguments, modify the command line
        in <code>ServiceDefinition.csdef</code>. The startup file and debug 
        options in your local project do not automatically transfer to the
        deployed service.
    </p>

    <h1>Troubleshooting Deployment</h1>

    <p>If your worker role does not behave correctly after deployment, check the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Your Python project includes a bin\ folder with (at least):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>ConfigureCloudService.ps1</code></li>
            <li><code>LaunchWorker.ps1</code></li>
            <li><code>ps.cmd</code></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your Cloud project references those files from the service definition.</li>
        <li>Your Python project includes a <code>requirements.txt</code> file listing all dependencies.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Enable Remote Desktop on your Cloud Service and investigate the log files.</p>
            <p>
                Logs for <code>ConfigureCloudService.ps1</code> and
                <code>LaunchWorker.ps1</code> are stored in the following path
                on the machine instance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>C:\Resources\Directory\%RoleId%.DiagnosticStore\LogFiles</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Currently, the <code>LaunchWorker.ps1</code> log is the only way
                to view output or errors displayed by your Python program.
